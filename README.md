  <details><summary>1-4 Setprecision in C++</summary><blockquote>
    Since a format specifier does not exist in C++, how can we set precision in a float value? For instance, If we want to shrink 2.568741 to 2.57, how can we do it?
    The method is as follows-
      
    float a;
    cin >> a;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << a;
